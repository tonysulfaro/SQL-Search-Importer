# SQL-Search-Importer
SQL Serch importer is a tool that I made to make getting data in and out of SQL Server easier. The application itself can import, read, and export data stored in SQL Server into a flat file or other types of files.

## Getting Started
Clone the repository to use the application. You may need to modify the application if you are not using SQL Authentication or are connecting to an Azure DB. 

### Prerequisites
*.NET 4.0+
*An instance of MSSQL either on-premise or in Azure

### Installing
When cloning the application it can be done either through the github desktop app or using

```
git clone https://github.com/tonysulfaro/SQL-Search-Importer.git
```

## Built With
* [.NET 4.7.2](https://www.microsoft.com/net) - The project framework used
* [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/default.aspx) - Where the data is stored
